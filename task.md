# Task 2

Maintaining a consistent formality level throughout the text is important, though not always simple; ML and AI can be helpful for that. Your goal is to create an evaluation system for a formality detection model.

We suggest the following steps for this test assignment:

- Collect the data for evaluation, e.g. you can use publicly available datasets, generate synthetic data, combine different approaches â€“ it's up to you.
- Research and choose the evaluation metrics.
- Explore the existing formality detection approaches (e.g. libraries, fine-tuned models, LLMs), pick some that you like and evaluate them on the created test set.

As a result, you should provide a link to a repository containing the source code and documentation, e.g.:

- Scripts containing data preparation and evaluation
- Documentation describing datasets, tools, and metrics you used
- A short report that describes your approach and ideas, summarises the results, and discusses the challenges you encountered
- Instructions on how to run and locally reproduce the results

Time Expectation: This task is designed to be completed in approximately 4-8 hours. While there's no strict time limit, we encourage you to manage your time efficiently and focus on the key aspects of the task.

Note: Please, do not use LLM to write any part of your application. We understand if you want to polish your response, but we would appreciate if you keep as many of your own words as possible.
